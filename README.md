# Install

1. Clone this SSH Key link: [GitHub](https://github.com/ruxpin86/Challenge-13-ORM-DU-BOOTCAMP) on your Terminal (Mac) or gitBash(Windows).

2. This app uses [Express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) and [Sequelize](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sequelize). You can simply install these by running "npm i" on your Integrated Terminal in VS-Code

3. Step by step guide video on how to use this app  and test routes after cloning, is attached below in [Preview](#preview). I used Insomnia specifically, but PostMan would work as well do demonstrate that it is functional.

# Learned
